Meshes
======

A mesh is a structured numerical grid on which discrete variables are organized.
Regarding numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), discrete variables
generally represent approximations to continuous functions.
Meshes can be created and used to solve PDEs in 1D, 2D or 3D.
For a given system of PDEs, the mesh defines a discrete representation of the domain and its boundaries.
Here, we provide a set of tutorials related to generating and understanding mesh types supported by the *discretize* package.
